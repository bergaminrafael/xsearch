# X!Search

Search engine for SVN directory based on Elasticsearch.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

- start typing to autofocus the search box (letters, numbers, space and backspace keys)
- use left and right arrow keys (&larr;,&rarr;) to navigate pages. *Focus can't be on search box* 

#### Known bugs

- v1.0.0

- [ ] "Go to" page on mobile version. Can only navigate with buttons (<, >). Need to find a way to capture Android's number keyboard "Enter" key (I think it's actually a "next" of some sort).
